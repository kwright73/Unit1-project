 <p class="overview">Hello, I'm 30 from Ohio residing in North Carolina.
 I have two daughters, one is 9 years old the other is 3.
 I am currently a teacher and looking for a career change.
 I have a degree in Human resources and
 I love spending time with my family.
 </p>
 <h2 id="my-start">How I got my Start</h2>
 <p>I actually didn't know anything about coding until a co-worker of
 mine was going to school for something similar.
 She introduced me to a course site called coursea. I signed up for
 data analytics but I love the web
 development they had on the learning. I started looking more into
 on youtube and that's how I got into coding.
 I started learning the basics for html, css, and javascript through
 codecademy and it went from there.
 I love the creative side of it and I want to grow with a company
 doing it. The tech industry I feel is always
evolving and I want to be a part of that growth.
 </p>
 <p>I ended up choosing grand circus because a year ago I applied for a
 position at dexian, not for web development.
 I was in the middle of trying to teach muyself coding and front end
 work for the past year, it was getting hard
 finding so many different learning sites and options. Fast Forward
 to today, I got a email from Dexian
 offering the course through this program. I definitely feel like if
 I have live help and an actually
 teacher to show me how everything works, I could focus and get it
 done. So, I accepted and I'm looking
 forward to learning so much more.
